## Project Overview
This project analyzes a Google Play Store database containing comprehensive information about installed apps. The analysis aims to provide insights into app reviews, installations, categories, and ratings. 

## Technologies Used
- **Databricks**: Collaborative platform for data science and engineering.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Apache Spark for big data processing.
- **Python SQL**: For executing SQL queries on DataFrames.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- `App`: Name of the application
- `Category`: Category of the application (e.g., Games, Productivity)
- `Reviews`: Number of reviews given to the app
- `Installs`: Number of installations
- `Price`: Price of the app (if applicable)
- `Rating`: Average rating of the app

## Analysis Tasks
The analysis includes the following tasks:
1. **Top 10 Reviews Given to Apps**: Identify the apps with the highest number of reviews.
2. **Top 10 Installed Apps**: Determine the most installed apps, categorizing them as free or paid.
3. **Category-wise Distribution of Apps**: Analyze the number of apps in each category.
4. **Top Paid Apps**: List the apps with the highest prices.
5. **Top 10 Rating Apps**: Find the apps with the highest average ratings.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create a Databricks account or access an existing workspace.
   - Create a new cluster in Databricks.

2. **Data Upload**:
   - Upload the Google Play Store dataset to the Databricks File System (DBFS).

3. **Code Execution**:
   - Create a new notebook and copy the following code snippets for each analysis task.

### Example Code Snippets
1. **Top 10 Reviews Given to Apps**:
   ```python
   top_reviews = df.orderBy(col("Reviews").desc()).limit(10)
   top_reviews.show()
   ```

2. **Top 10 Installed Apps**:
   ```python
   top_installs = df.withColumn("Installs", regexp_replace(col("Installs"), "[^0-9]", "").cast(IntegerType())) \
                    .orderBy(col("Installs").desc()).limit(10)
   top_installs.show()
   ```

3. **Category-wise Distribution of Apps**:
   ```python
   category_distribution = df.groupBy("Category").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)
   category_distribution.show()
   ```

4. **Top Paid Apps**:
   ```python
   top_paid_apps = df.filter(col("Price") > 0).orderBy(col("Price").desc()).limit(10)
   top_paid_apps.show()
   ```

5. **Top 10 Rating Apps**:
   ```python
   top_rated_apps = df.orderBy(col("Rating").desc()).limit(10)
   top_rated_apps.show()
   ```

## Results
The results from each analysis task will provide valuable insights into app popularity, distribution, and pricing strategies. Specific results can be summarized here or presented in a separate analysis report.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of data analysis in understanding app market dynamics. The insights gained can inform app developers and marketers about trends and user preferences.
